## Background

Hi there, I am Jason from Malaysia, currently working as a postdoc in Taiwan.
I travel across Taiwan to deploy and actively maintain slope monitoring stations, perform geophysical exploration (surface and borehole) works at engineering scale.
Despite my major in geotechnical engineering, I am also an amateur maker who loves to integrate my hobbies into ongoing projects to make life better for everyone.

Originally tinkered with some arduino unos and nanos, I found that commercially available solutions are either too expensive or too proprietary for full integration.
Thanks to the open source community in arduino and raspi, I managed to interface a lot of monitoring hardwares (TDR, pressure sensors, inclinometers) to extremely flexible arduino/raspi.

This github page is for some side projects, including Internet-of-Things (IoT) software/hardware integration and OS related solutions.
I usually experiment with arduino, stm32, espressif (esp8266, esp32), raspberry pi and other MCU boards.

Starting from breadboarding and soldering through-hole board PCBs, I have currently arrived at prototyping custom PCB with KiCAD and easyEDA.

If you are interested in collaboration or wants some help in starting your own PCB, feel free to drop me an email.

Below is my CV, just in case, cheers!

# Research

My doctoral research focused on broadband dielectric spectroscopy using advanced time domain reflectometry (TDR) analyses in geotechnical and geo-environmental monitoring. Through implementing self-referencing signal     processing approach on conventional TDR methods and model-free non-linear optimization, the dielectric spectrum of materials can be measured accurately, rapidly, efficiently, cost-effectively both in laboratory and field environment, which only requires minimal calibration effort and has high adaptation robustness to survey conditions. This technique is implemented in soil dielectric spectroscopy to identify the effects on electrical properties from dry density, specific surface area and other factors.

I completed my doctoral degree in civil engineering with specialization in geotechnical engineering and engineering geophysics in Oct 2019. I pursued my doctoral studies under the supervision of Prof. Chih-Ping Lin in the Department of Civil Engineering, NCTU. During my years in the Geo-Imaging and Geo-Nerve Research Group, I led numerous engineering geophysical field surveys and managed projects from planning, data analysis, intercommunication, and report presentation to authorities. I have experience in electromagnetic, electrical and seismic geophysical methods, including time domain reflectometry, ground penetrating radar, electrical resistivity tomography, seismic refraction, seismic reflection and surface seismic field tests for engineering scale. During my five years of doctoral studies, I led my field team to perform numerous in-situ borehole geophysics all over Taiwan, including borehole PS-logging, borehole TDR, borehole electrical-logging, downhole seismic tests, borehole televiewer (acoustic and optical), and borehole electrical resistivity tomography (BERT).

Upon graduation from my doctoral studies, I have been working as a postdoctoral researcher at the Disaster Prevention and Water Environment Research Center (DPWE), NCTU. My main project is mainly on low-powered TDR based slope monitoring in deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DSGSD) sites, with regional wireless sensor network (WSN) Internet of Things (IoT) deployment for ground water level and soil moisture content monitoring. 3 sites with a total of 8 TDR monitoring boreholes (some integrated with piezometers or inclinometer casing) and 10 standalone wireless sensors. I developed the all the automation GUI and required drivers with python, and integrated Raspberry Pi and Arduino based data logger within 3 months. Field deployments were accomplished by my co-advised master's student and me. Inter-disciplinary collaboration between remote sensing, passive induced seismicity, and surface geophysics were performed extensively in these projects. Apart from the main project, my side projects include multi-channel analysis of surface waves (MASW) survey for dam safety inspection and various borehole geophysics in multiple engineering sites (including nuclear power plants). I have been involved in the energy generation monitoring in a microhydropower site in Zhudong, where both the software and hardware interface of the data acquisition is handled by myself, and provide real-time data monitoring through IoT infrastructures for further hydraulic and mechanical analysis.
